Function pointers
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Africa SE. It aims to learn about function pointers in C language.

Technologies
C files are compiled using `gcc
C files are written according to the C90 standard
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

Filename	Description
0-print_name.c	Prints a name
1-array_iterator.c	Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array
2-int_index.c	Searches for an integer
3-calc.h	Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures
3-op_functions.c	File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations
3-get_op_func.c	Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions
3-main.c	Entry point
100-main_opcodes.c	Prints the opcodes of its own main function
What are function pointers and how to use them
What does a function pointer exactly hold
Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
0. What's my name
Write a function that prints a name.
1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Write a function that searches for an integer.
3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Write a program that performs simple operations.
4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker
Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
