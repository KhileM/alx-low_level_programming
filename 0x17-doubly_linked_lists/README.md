In C, a doubly linked list is a data structure composed of nodes where each node contains data and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This structure allows for efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions.

Operations on a doubly linked list include:

Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or in the middle of the list.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Accessing each node in the list, either in the forward or backward direction.
Search: Finding a specific node based on its value.
To manipulate a doubly linked list, you perform operations by updating the pointers of nodes accordingly. For example, when inserting a new node, you adjust the pointers of the neighboring nodes to link the new node appropriately.

Doubly linked lists provide flexibility and efficient traversal in both directions, making them useful in scenarios where forward and backward navigation is required, such as implementing undo/redo functionality, maintaining a cache, or managing a history of operations.
