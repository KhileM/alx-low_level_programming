A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of key-value pairs. It is widely used in computer science due to its fast lookup time.

In the context of the C programming language, a hash table can be implemented using arrays and linked lists. The basic idea is to use a hash function to map keys to array indices, where the actual data is stored. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. Hash Function: A hash function takes a key as input and computes an index value that corresponds to a specific location in the array. The goal of a good hash function is to distribute the keys evenly across the array to minimize collisions (multiple keys mapping to the same index).

2. Array: A fixed-size array is used to store the key-value pairs. Each element in the array is often called a "bucket" or "slot". The size of the array should be chosen carefully, considering the expected number of elements and the desired trade-off between memory usage and lookup performance.

3. Collision Handling: Since multiple keys may map to the same array index due to the limited size of the array, collisions can occur. There are several collision resolution techniques, but one common approach is to use linked lists. Each array index contains a linked list of key-value pairs that share the same index. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is appended to the linked list at the corresponding index.

4. Insertion and Retrieval: To insert a new key-value pair, the hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array where it should be stored. If there is no collision, the pair is simply inserted at that index. If a collision occurs, the pair is appended to the linked list at the index. To retrieve a value associated with a given key, the hash function is again applied to the key to find the corresponding index, and then the linked list at that index is traversed to locate the value.

Hash tables provide efficient average-case time complexity for insertion, retrieval, and deletion operations, typically O(1), but the worst-case time complexity can be O(n) if there are many collisions. The efficiency of a hash table depends on the quality of the hash function, the size of the array, and the collision resolution strategy.

It's worth noting that in C, implementing a hash table requires manual memory management and careful handling of pointers to ensure memory leaks and other issues are avoided.
