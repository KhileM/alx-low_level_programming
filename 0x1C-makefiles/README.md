A "Makefile" in C is a special text file used to automate the compilation and building of C programs. It contains instructions for a build system called "make" to manage dependencies and execute the necessary compiler commands. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Target and Dependencies: A Makefile defines targets (usually, the names of executable programs) and their dependencies (source code files, headers, etc.). For example:

make
Copy code
myprogram: main.c util.c
Rules: Under each target, you specify the rules to create that target from its dependencies. These rules typically include the compilation command. For example:

make
Copy code
myprogram: main.c util.c
    gcc -o myprogram main.c util.c
Indentation: Makefiles use tabs (not spaces) to define rules. Indentation is crucial, as make relies on it to understand the relationships between targets and dependencies.

Comments: You can include comments using # at the beginning of a line.

Variables: Makefiles can use variables to store compiler flags, file paths, or other information, making it easier to maintain and modify build configurations.

Implicit Rules: Make has built-in implicit rules for common file types like .c to .o (object) file compilation, so you often don't need to specify rules for every source file.

Phony Targets: You can define phony targets (those that don't represent actual files) to perform auxiliary tasks like cleaning, testing, or installing.
