In this task, I learned and bit manipulation and how to use the bitwise operators >>, <<, &, |, and ^ in C.

Bits are tiny pieces of information that computers use to understand things. Just like we use letters to make words, computers use bits to make numbers and other information. Bit manipulation is like playing with building blocks. You can take blocks apart and put them back together in different ways to make new shapes and structures. Similary, with bit manipulation you can take apart numbers made up of bits and put them back together in different ways to get different results.
